# unitary-construction-and-decomposition

To use the quantum memory states given by the quantum inference
protocol, one has to first construct the unitary operator. The
methodology of the construction was given in the paper Phys.
Rev. Lett. 120, 240502 (2018).

This set of codes is made up of two parts:
(1) Constructing the unitary operator.
(2) Decomposing the unitary operator.

An example of how to use the code(s) is given in the file
titled "Script_How_to_use_unitary_construction_decomposition.m"
